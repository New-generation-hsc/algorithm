|    Binary Heap    |
+-------------------+

this file implement the common tree-base data structure `binary heap`.

binary heap must satisify two constraints:

- Shape property: a binary heap is a complete binary tree
- Heap property: the parent value must be larger or equal to its children if it is a max-heap
                  or less then or equal to its children if it is a min-heap
